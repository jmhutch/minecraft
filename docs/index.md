Welcome!
</p>
<p>
My goal is to provide an updated guide to minecraft modding that falls between the common "type this, then this..." youtube tutorial that gives you (hopefully) working examples but little to no explanation or theory - and the typical forum response of "look it up in the vanilla code".
</p>
<p>
I hope to find a happy medium, providing samples and examples, and referencing vanilla code whenever possible, to guide the prospective modding student in a way that both illustrates concepts and teaches principles. In short, I hope to give you a fish to start with, then teach you how to catch your own as well, so that you're able to apply techniques across different situations and not be limited to that single fish.
