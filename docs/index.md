### Welcome!


My goal is to provide an updated guide to minecraft modding that falls between the common "type this, then this..." youtube tutorial that gives you (hopefully) working examples but little to no explanation or theory - and the typical forum response of "look it up in the vanilla code".


I hope to find a happy medium, providing samples and examples, and referencing vanilla code whenever possible, to guide the prospective modding student in a way that both illustrates concepts and teaches principles. In short, I hope to give you a fish to start with, then teach you how to catch your own as well, so that you're able to apply techniques across different situations and not be limited to that single fish.


ToDo:

- [ ] Setup Guide - install Eclipse, get Forge, set up workspace
- [ ] Getting Started - basic mod setup/boilerplate and common code structure
- [ ] Items - create custom items
- [ ] Textures and json - what, where, how
- [ ] CreativeTabs - quick but necessary... gotta have custom tabs
- [ ] Blocks - create custom blocks and events for them
- [ ] Blockstates - exciting topic everybody loves!
- [ ] Events - make things do stuff
- [ ] TileEntities - aka how to associate data with blocks
- [ ] TileEntities with storage - see above, plus storage!
- [ ] Tools - sidestep into modelling tools and utils to prepare for...
- [ ] Entities - that topic every other tutorial avoids! Models, Entities, Renderers, oh my!
- [ ] Gui stuff - UIs for things.
- [ ] WorldGen - Add Ore, Trees, etc. and modify biomes in general
- [ ] Dimensions - playing with dimensional creation and travel
- [ ] Config stuff
- [ ] Update this list with whatever else I've missed...
- [ ] add comment/discussion system to article pages
